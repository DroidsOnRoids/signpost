This is main part of [oauth-signpost](https://github.com/mttkay/signpost)
refactored to use [httpclientandroidlib](https://code.google.com/p/httpclientandroidlib) instead of
Apache HttpClient. signpost-commonshttp3 and signpost-jetty6 have not been refactored.

httpclientandroidlib have to be installed to local maven repo
